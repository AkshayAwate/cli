## ‚ö°Ô∏è [Quick start](https://create-go.app/quick-start/)

First of all, [download](https://golang.org/dl/) and install **Go**. Version `1.11` or higher is required.

Installation is done by using the [`go build`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_packages_and_dependencies) command with `$GOPATH/bin`:

```bash
go build -i -o $GOPATH/bin/cgapp github.com/create-go-app/cli
```

Let's create a new project via **interactive console UI** (or **CUI**) into current folder:

```bash
cgapp create
```

Okay, it works! Now, you can run this project on your **local machine** or deploy to a **remote server**. Project works in isolated Docker containers and automates via Ansible playbook:

```bash
cgapp deploy
```

### ~ Docker-way to quick start

If you don't want to install Create Go App CLI to your system, you feel free to using our official [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/koddr/cgapp) and run CLI from isolated container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} koddr/cgapp:latest
```

> ‚òùÔ∏è Also, with this Docker image, you do **not** have to worry about installing tools/CLI of frontend UI libraries/frameworks. Everything is **already included** to this Docker image: `create-react-app`, `preact-cli`, `vue-cli`, `ng-cli` and `degit` (for Svelte).

That's all you need to start! üéâ

## ‚öôÔ∏è [Commands & Options](https://create-go.app/detailed-guides/commands-and-options/)

### [`init`](https://create-go.app/detailed-guides/commands-and-options/#init)

CLI command for generate a default `.cgapp.yml` config file in current folder:

```bash
cgapp init
```

<details>
<summary>Generated config file</summary>

<br/>

```yaml
# Project config.
project:
  # Backend for your project.
  # (Required)
  # String: `net/http`, `fiber`, `echo`, `gin`
  # User template: supported, set to URL (without protocol),
  # like `github.com/user/template`
  - backend: fiber

  # Frontend for your project.
  # (Optional, to skip set to `none`)
  # String:
  #   - `react`, `react:<template>`

    # to ask for a privilege escalation password.
    # (Optional)
    become: true

    # Host name from your inventory file (usually, at /etc/ansible/hosts).
    # (Required)

### [`create`](https://create-go.app/detailed-guides/commands-and-options/#create)

CLI command to create a new project with the selected configuration.

There's two ways to create a new project:

- [x] With an interactive console UI (or CUI).
- [x] From configuration file (by default, in `$PWD/.cgapp.yml`).

#### Create with the interactive console UI

Run `create` command **without** any arguments:

```bash
cgapp create
```

#### Create from the config file

Run `create` command **with** `--use-config` (or `-c`) argument:

```bash
cgapp create --use-config
```

### [`deploy`](https://create-go.app/detailed-guides/commands-and-options/#deploy)

CLI command for deploy Docker containers with your project to a remote server.

> ‚òùÔ∏è You should only run this command from the **root folder** of your project, which created with the `cgapp create` command! It's a necessary condition for everything to work perfectly.

There's, also, two ways to deploy your project:

- [x] With an interactive console UI (or CUI).
- [x] From configuration file (by default, in `$PWD/.cgapp.yml`).

#### Deploy with the interactive console UI

Run `deploy` command **without** any arguments:

```bash
cgapp deploy
```

#### Deploy from the config file

Run `deploy` command **with** `--use-config` (or `-c`) argument:

```bash
cgapp deploy --use-config
```

## ü§î Why another CLI?

Yes, when we started this project, we asked ourselves this question too and... came to the conclusion, that about **8-10** routine steps in each project can be automated with a smart CLI.

The Create Go App project allow you to prepare and deploy your project **without** any unnecessary headaches.
