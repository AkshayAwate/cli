## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

First of all, [download](https://golang.org/dl/) and install **Go**. Version `1.16` or higher is required.

Installation is done by using the [`go install`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies) command and rename installed binary in `$GOPATH/bin`:

```bash
go install github.com/create-go-app/cli/cmd/cgapp@latest

# If you want to reduce binary size, you can run this command with options:
CGO_ENABLED=0 go install -ldflags="-s -w" github.com/create-go-app/cli/cmd/cgapp@latest
```

Also, macOS and GNU/Linux users available way to install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
# Tap a new formula:
brew tap create-go-app/cli

# Installation:
brew install create-go-app/cli/cgapp
```

Let's create a new project via **interactive console UI** (or **CUI** for short) into current folder:

```bash
cgapp create
```

Okay, it works! Now, you can create a new pre-configured Ansible inventory file in current folder:

```bash
cgapp generate -p traefik
```

Open the generated file (called `hosts.ini`) and fill in the variables according to your server configuration. Now you are ready to automatically deploy the project on the remote server:

```bash
cgapp deploy
```

That's all you need to know to start! üéâ

### ~ Docker-way to quick start

If you don't want to install Create Go App CLI to your system, you feel free to using our official [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/koddr/cgapp) and run CLI from isolated container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:${PWD} -w ${PWD} koddr/cgapp:latest
```

With this Docker image, you do **not** have to worry about installing tools/CLI of frontend UI libraries/frameworks. Everything is **already included**: `create-react-app`, `preact-cli`, `vue-cli`, `ng-cli` and `degit` (for Svelte and Sapper).

Available commands for [official Docker image](https://create-go.app/detailed-guides/official-docker-image/):

- [x] [`create`](https://create-go.app/detailed-guides/commands-and-options/#create)
- [x] [`generate`](https://create-go.app/detailed-guides/commands-and-options/#generate)

> üîî Please note: a [`deploy`](https://create-go.app/detailed-guides/commands-and-options/#deploy) command is currently unavailable in this image.

### `deploy`

Make sure that you have [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Ansible 2.9+](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-specific-operating-systems) installed on your computer. Run `deploy` command:

## ü§î Why another CLI?

When we started this project, we asked ourselves this question too and... came to the conclusion, that approximately 8 out of 10 routine operations at the start of a new project and/or the deployment of an existing one **can be automated**. And it would be better to have all the necessary functions inside one CLI. That's why we transferred all our experience to the Create Go App CLI, which we use ourselves!

So, yes, this CLI gives you the ability to prepare everything you need to **start a new project** (as `create-react-app` for the React.js ecosystem does) and **deploy an existing project** to a remote server in configured and fully isolated Docker containers.

## üìù Production-ready project templates

**Backend:**

- [x] [`net/http`](https://create-go.app/production-templates/net-http-go/) ‚Äî Backend template with Golang built-in [net/http](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/) package.
- [x] [`fiber`](https://create-go.app/production-templates/fiber-go/) ‚Äî Backend template with [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber).

**Frontend:**

- [x] `react` ‚Äî [React](https://reactjs.org/) frontend app.
  - `react:<template>` ‚Äî CRA generated template for React app.
- [x] `preact` ‚Äî [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) frontend app.
  - `preact:<template>` ‚Äî Preact CLI generated template for Preact app.
- [x] `vue` ‚Äî [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) frontend app.
  - `vue:<user/repo>` ‚Äî Preset for generating Vue.js app from GitHub.
  - `vue:<gitlab|bitbucket>:<user/repo>` ‚Äî Preset for generating Vue.js app from GitLab/BitBucket/etc.
- [x] `angular` ‚Äî [Angular](https://angular.io/) frontend app.
- [x] `svelte` ‚Äî [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) frontend app.
- [x] `sapper` ‚Äî [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) frontend app for static websites.
  - `sapper:<webpack>` ‚Äî Preset for generating Sapper with Webpack bundler.

> ‚òùÔ∏è Frontend part of your project will be generated **using official CLI** from the authors of each frontend UI library/framework (_under the hood_). So, you'll always get the latest version of `React`, `Preact`, `Vue.js`, `Angular`, `Svelte` or `Sapper` for your project from their authors!

## üöö Configured Ansible roles

**Web/Proxy server:**

- [x] `traefik` ‚Äî role for run Docker container with [Traefik Proxy](https://traefik.io/traefik/).
- [x] `nginx` ‚Äî role for run Docker container with [Nginx](https://nginx.org).

> ‚òùÔ∏è Since Create Go App CLI `v2.0.0`, we're strongly recommend to use **Traefik Proxy** as default proxy server for your projects.

## üë§ My own custom templates?

Create Go App CLI provide works with **your own** custom templates, instead of those prepared by authors. Just specify backend (`-b`) and frontend (`-f`) with addresses to their repositories in `create` command:

```console
cgapp create \
  -b github.com/user1/my-template-1 \
  -f bitbucket.org/user2/my-template-2
```

> ‚òùÔ∏è The `https://` protocol will be added automatically!

## üëµ How to install older version?

You can do it by using a version suffix in `go install` command:

```bash
go install github.com/create-go-app/cli/cmd/cgapp@2.0.0
```

> ‚òùÔ∏è Don't forget to rename binary after installation, according to the version you have installed! This must be done to avoid confusion with the latest version.
>
> For example: `mv $GOPATH/bin/cgapp $GOPATH/bin/cgapp_v2_0_0` and run it by `cgapp_v2_0_0 [COMMAND]`.

Found all available CLI versions on our [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/create-go-app/cli?tab=versions) page.
